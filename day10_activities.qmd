### Reading in the files

```{r}

daily_meteor <- read_csv(here("data", "ntl20_v6.csv"))
ice_cover <- read_csv(here("data", "ntl33_v7.csv"), na = c("-999", "")) 
```

## Creating visualizations

```{r}

ice_sums <- ice_cover |> 
  group_by(lakeid, season, year4) |> 
  summarize(mean = mean(ice_duration, na.rm = TRUE), median = median(ice_duration, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  filter(year4 > 1999)

ggplot(ice_cover, aes(x = lakeid, y = ice_duration)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.4) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = NA, width = 0.5) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "Ice Duration", y = " Lake")

madison_year_mean <- ice_cover |> 
  group_by(year4) |> 
  summarize(mean = mean(ice_duration, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(madison_year_mean, aes(x = year4, y = mean)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(caption = "There seems to be cyclical trends for the mean ice duration throughout the years.")
